## Approach for Development

- [ ] **Identify Flaws in Current Honeypots**  
  Conduct research on existing open-source honeypots to pinpoint their limitations and vulnerabilities.

- [ ] **Discover Attack Vectors**  
  Explore how malicious actors exploit these flaws to compromise systems.

- [ ] **Select an Open-Source Honeypot**  
  Choose a suitable open-source honeypot project as the base for further development.

- [ ] **Mitigate Flaws**  
  Implement features and improvements to address the identified weaknesses, enhancing security and functionality.

- [ ] **Documentation and Research Publication**  
  Document all findings, development steps, and results. Compile this work into a research paper and publish it to contribute to the cybersecurity community.
